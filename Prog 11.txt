Write a program that prompts the user for a number. Use a loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence (each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers) up to the nth term entered by the user.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FibonacciSequence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the value of n for Fibonacci sequence: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        int first = 0, second = 1;
        System.out.println("Fibonacci sequence up to " + n + " terms:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(first + " ");
            int next = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = next;
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
